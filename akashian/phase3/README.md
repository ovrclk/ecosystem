# Akashian Phase 3

The Akashian Challenge Phase 3 will test and showcase Akash DeCloud’s deployment platform. Akashian Challengers will be incentivized to deploy applications using the Akash Network. Encompassing two weeks, Phase 3 will include guided challenges for deploying applications of increasing complexity — from simple single-page applications to blockchain network components, and open ended challenges where users can show off their Akash OPS skills by extending the guided examples to deploy any application they desire — from DeFi to CI.

There are additional rewards for participation outside of the deployment challenges, including contributions such as active validator participation, writing blog posts and how-to guides, and sharing novel uses of our platform.

**Qualification Criteria**:

Although we do not limit anyone from participating, to claim AKT rewards:

* You must not be a resident of any of the OFAC sanctioned countries.
* You must pass KYC/AML verification when collecting the reward. The details for which will be posted at a later time.
