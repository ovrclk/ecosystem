# Akash Ecosystem Rewards

As the world’s first supercloud for serverless computing, Akash needs your support to materialize our vision of empowering the architects and builders of the internet with greater access, freedom, and efficiency to create products that improve the human experience.

In these early days, we want you to join and help us establish the foundation for a valuable and engaged community. In this effort, we’re excited to announce the Akash Founding Member Rewards Program!

Of the 100,000,000 tokens that will ever be pre-mined at genesis, we’re allocating 2% (2,000,000 AKT’s!) to a reward program for early contributors in our community.  Our reward program is inspired by projects from the community, such as Solana’s [Tour de Sol](https://solana.com/tds/), Cosmos [Game of Stakes](https://github.com/cosmos/game-of-stakes), and Kava [Founder Rewards](https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kava/blob/master/docs/REWARDS.md).

## Akash Founding Member Rewards Program

Our Founding Member Rewards Program focuses on Akash Testnet participation.  The program is limited to only 100 members and involves 3 challenges.  Each challenge has a corresponding reward, for a total of **3,500** AKTs:
